#. The Executive shall be responsible for the following duties:

   #. The activities of the club;
   #. The finances of the club;
   #. Appointing members to the Committee;

::

   Constitution amendment note:

   Arc requires that the responsibilities of a Wellfare Officer be present within the Constitution for reaffiliation.
   These responsibilities will largely be reflected within the role of the Community Liaison, and
   these duties cannot be shared by the President. Further details can be found below in Section 3.2.4.

   Arc strongly recommends the addition of clause 7.6, with the reasoning: "This aims to reduce the harm
   and distress caused by public EGMs and provide a common-sense solution to ensure your team can be at full strength."
   Clauses 7.3 and 7.6 are to better align with the Arc Clubs Model Constitution.

   Arc strongly recommends the addition of clause 10, with the reasoning that a full EGM within 4 weeks of
   the AGM is rather unnnecesary, especially in the case of someone going overseas for exchange starting in term 3.

   With a growing committee size and greater ambitions, the 2024 Executive team believe it is time for
   the Executive team to grow in accordance. We feel the inclusion of vice presidents will greater allow for
   responsibilities of portfolios to be handled be a dedicated person focused on bringing out the best of
   that area of the club. In doing so, the required responsibilities for the Co-Presidents has reduced
   to the point we believe only one president is necessary for the club. Further information of the new roles
   can be found below in Section 3.2.5, as well as smaller changes to reflect the new Executive team that may not have notes attached.

   Constitution amendment note:

   The addition of the new Vice President roles will take over the specific portfolio supervisory work
   That was part of the co-presidents responsibilities. In summary, The VP Internals would do the
   Internals work of the Co-President (Internals), the VP Outreach would do the Externals and Programmes
   work of the Co-President (Externals), and the VP Operations would do supervisory work for Creative,
   Media, Dev and HR that wa shared amongst the Secretary, Treasurer and Community Liaison that wasn't
   previously listed in their specific roles. We hope this larger team will have a better spread of workload
   to facilitate the ever-growing society, and that this larger team can also cover for burnout more
   effectively.

::

   Explantory Note:

   CompClub is unique in that we conduct one of our flagship events during the Summer University Holidays. Section 3.1 clause 5
   and Section 3.5 were added to the Constitution to account for the administrative and logistical challenges
   that arise whilst conducting Club activities during this period of drastic change. These clauses ensure that the Club's
   planned activities operate smoothly under the jurisdiction of the outgoing Executive as the Executive-elect and
   Committee-elect familiarise themselves with their respective roles.

   The Executive-elect is suggested to carry on their duties outlined in Section 3.1 clause 3 within the context of their tenure.
   The outgoing Executive is strong advised against enacting decisions that will infringe on the duties and decisions of the
   Executive-elect within the context of Executive-elect's tenure, and should merely act as an advisory body.

   Constitution amendment note:

   for our General Meetings with elections, but must now be explicitly listed in the Constitution.
